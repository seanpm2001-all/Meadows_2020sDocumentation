Kernel plans (new)

Use the Linux kernel, but also develop a backup kernel with low priority. There really is no need to do full development on a new system kernel when great projects like Linux have so much work already put into them. Focus should go to improving Linux, and not creating new kernels, specifically things like audio system improvements, bloat, and CPU/GPU/Device support fixes.
